The program - GEO-POINTS WITH A FILE - demonstrates how to define a class with a file. It is going to change the GeoPoint Class of the last program: [MlengelaPD8](https://github.com/CIS1250Python/MlengelaPD8/blob/main/MlengelaDP8.zip), instead of only working with
two points, the project is going to read in a list of five or more points in a file.
